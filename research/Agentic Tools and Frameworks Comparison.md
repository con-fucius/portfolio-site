## Notable Limitations
- **Amazon Nova**: Agentic features are primarily exposed via Amazon Bedrock Agents and APIs. Custom orchestration requires more manual implementation compared to the others.
- **OpenAI Agent SDK**: Some advanced orchestration patterns (e.g., recursive, complex multi-agent) may require additional code or are less opinionated than ADK/Cloudflare.
- **Cloudflare Agents Framework**: Deep integration with Cloudflare platform; best suited for edge/serverless and stateful microservices.
- **Google ADK**: Most comprehensive for multi-agent, workflow, and agent-as-tool patterns. Native support for hierarchical, parallel, loop, and human-in-the-loop workflows.
